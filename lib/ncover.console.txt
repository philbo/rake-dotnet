Usage: ncover.console [<application to start> [<application args>]]
                      [//svc <service name>]
                      [//iis]
                      [other NCover arguments]


NCover Command Line Arguments
 NOTE: Any command line parameters that do not start with '//' are passed
       to the launched application on its command line.

 //at <filename>
    - Create trend data from the coverage data and append it to the given file.
      Creates the file if it doesn't exist.
 //bi <build id>
    - Attaches a custom build id to the coverage data gathered.
      A random unique ID will be created otherwise.
      (Any string is a valid build id)
 //cr <filename>
    - Reads settings from the given file, overriding existing settings.
 //cs <filename>
    - Saves the current settings to a file
 //ct <comma delimited list>
    - Specify desired coverage types in a comma delimited list.
      Example: //ct "Symbol, Branch, MethodVisits"
      Values: "Symbol","Branch","CyclomaticComplexity","MethodVisits"
      Default: Symbol, Branch, MethodVisits, CyclomaticComplexity

Include and Exclude rules
 NOTE: Include rules are processed before exclude rules
 NOTE: Each command in this set uses the same formart - a semi-colon delimited
       list of regular expressions
       Example: ".*test;gonewiththe$;^ncover\.test.*\.dll$"

 //eas <regex list>
    - Assemblies matching the regular expressions will be excluded
      from coverage (the assembly name does not include the extension)
 //ea  <regex list>
    - Namespaces, Classes, and Methods with an attribute that matches one
      of the regular expressions will be excluded from coverage.
      (the fully-qualified name of the attribute is used,
      e.g. System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttribute)
 //ef  <regex list>
    - Source files whose path matches one of the regular expressions will be
      excluded from coverage. (the full-path of the source file at compile-time
      is used, e.g. "D:\castletech\operations\dev\ncover\resources\setting.cs"
 //et  <regex list>
    - Namespaces and Classes whose fully-qualified name matches one of these
      regular expressions will be excluded from coverage.
      (inner classes are separated from their parents by a '+' not a '.'
      e.g. namespace.class+innerclass)
 //em  <regex list>
    - Methods whose fully-qualified name matches one of these regular
      expressions will be excluded from coverage.

 //ias <regex list>
    - Assemblies matching the regular expressions will be included
      into coverage (the assembly name does not include the extension)
 //ia  <regex list>
    - Namespaces, Classes, and Methods with an attribute that matches one
      of the regular expressions will be included into coverage.
      (the fully-qualified name of the attribute is used,
      e.g. System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttribute)
 //if  <regex list>
    - Source files whose path matches one of the regular expressions will be
      included into coverage. (the full-path of the source file at compile-time
      is used, e.g. "D:\castletech\operations\dev\ncover\resources\setting.cs"
 //it  <regex list>
    - Namespaces and Classes whose fully-qualified name matches one of these
      regular expressions will be included into coverage.
      (inner classes are separated from their parents by a '+' not a '.'
      e.g. namespace.class+innerclass)

 //iis
    - NCover will start IIS and cover any code executed within it.
      Once IIS is stopped NCover will gather the coverage data.
      NCover will stop IIS if it is already running before starting it again.
 //na
    - Turn off auto-exclusion of compiler-generated code
 //h  <folder name>
    - Write the 'FullCoverageReport' html report to the given folder.
 //l  <filename>
    - Write coverage messages to the given log file.
      CHANGE FROM 2.1: Messages will not be written unless //ll is used
 //ll <log level>
    - Specify profiler log level
      Values: "None"[default], "Normal", "Verbose"
 //p  <project name>
    - Provide a project name to display in the html report
      Default: "New Project"
 //pm <process name>
    - When set, instead of covering the process that is passed on the
      command line, NCover will cover all (child) processes whose name is an
      exact (case-insensitive) match of the given process name.
 //reg
    - Temporarily enable NCover for the current user.
      NOTE: This argument will not work for the //iis or the //svc arguments.
 //ssp <comma delimited list>
    - Set where NCover will search for PDBs for the assemblies it covers
      Values: "Registry","SymbolServer","BuildPath","ExecutingDir"
      Default: Registry, SymbolServer, BuildPath, ExecutingDir
 //st <minutes>
    - After the given number of minutes, NCover will forcibly stop IIS or the
      service started with //svc and gather coverage data from it.
      Pass 0 (zero) to tell NCover not to stop the service.
      (By default, NCover will not stop the service)
 //svc <service name>
    - NCover will start and cover any code executed within the given service
      NOTE: the parameter is the service's "Service Name" not the "Display Name"
 //w  <folder name>
    - Set the working directory of the covered application.
      NOTE: Does not apply to IIS or a service started with //svc
      NOTE: Does not apply to any //pm process
 //wal <minutes>
    - Tell NCover to wait the given number of minutes for the application to
      start up. If the application has not started up after the given amount
      of time, NCover will assume that it will never start up, and then exit.
      Default: 1 minute
 //x  <filename>
    - Write a coverage data file to the given filename
      Default: .\coverage.xml
